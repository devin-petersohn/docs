\subsection{R*}

\begin{itemize}
\item Assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item There are administrative causes behind distributed data
\item Network: unreliable transport, in-order, packets are intact
\item Independent node failure
\item Slow-ish network
\end{itemize}
\item Research goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item ``Site autonomy'': No centralized state or control
\begin{itemize}
\item Data you touch should determine the sites you talk to
\item ``Distributed system is a system that fails because a machine you've never heard of fails''
\item Load sharing and decentralization
\item Less communication
\item Harder to coordinate data consistency
\item More network connections beyond hub and spoke
\item Metadata management is harder
\end{itemize}
\item Location transparency $\rightarrow$ emulate a centralized DB
\item Don't assume much about the network or OS
\end{itemize}
\item Highlights:
\begin{itemize}
\item Query optimizer cost modeling
\item Data layouts $\rightarrow$ horizontal partitioning
\item Replication
\item Distribution
\item Query compilation---unclear as to balance between compilation overhead and work saving
\item Spent a lot of time talking about 2PC $\rightarrow$ presumed commit
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Gamma}

\begin{itemize}
\item Assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fast interconnect---hypercube, more network bandwidth than aggregate disk bandwidth
\item Shared nothing---no disk or memory sharing
\end{itemize}
\item Research goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Scale
\end{itemize}
\item Highlights:
\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel hybrid-hash join
\item Chained declustering
\end{itemize}
\item Assess:
\begin{itemize}
\item Linear speedup + scale-up
\item Superlinear speedup due to minimized seek count at scale
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
