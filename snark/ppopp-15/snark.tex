\abstract

Nested arrays present a natural programming interface for expressing many different parallel
algorithms. In this paper, we present the \textbf{S}calable \textbf{N}ested \textbf{AR}ray
\textbf{K}it~(\texttt{Snark}), a distributed framework for expressing computation on nested arrays.

\section{Introduction}

\label{sec:introduction}

The nested array programming model was introduced by Blelloch~\cite{blelloch90} as a
functional programming model for expressing data parallel computation.

Although several implementations of the nested vector model have been published, all of the
implementations have been designed to exploit parallelism from multiple cores on a single node.
\texttt{Snark} provides a distributed implementation of canonical nested array operations on top of the
Apache Spark~\cite{zaharia10} in-memory map-reduce framework. Instead of using static techniques to
extract parallelism from the computation, \texttt{Snark} dynamically inspects the structure of the nested
arrays that are being computed upon to optimize the distribution of data and computation.
