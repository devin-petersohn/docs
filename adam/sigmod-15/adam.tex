\title{Design Principles for Modular and Scalable \linebreak Scientific Analysis Systems}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

%  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{}
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.
%
% 1st. author% There's nothing stopping you putting the seventh, eighth, etc.
% author on the opening page (as the 'third row') but we ask,
% for aesthetic reasons that you place these 'additional authors'
% in the \additional authors block, viz.

% Just remember to make sure that the TOTAL number of authors
% is the number that will appear on the first page PLUS the
% number that will appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\begin{abstract}
Revolutions in data-acquisition are drastically changing how science conducts experiments. For
example, the advent of ``next-generation'' sequencing technologies has led to a 10,000$\times$
decrease, which has led to exponential growth in the total volume of genome sequence data and
improvements in our understanding of genetics. This broader trend has lead to the rise of ``data
science'' and \emph{data-driven discovery}, and many of these analysis problems are amenable to
extant analytics systems.

In this paper, we introduce a set of principles for decomposing scientific analysis systems so that they
can be implemented efficiently on top of existing systems. We motivate these principles with an
example genomics pipeline which leverages open-source MapReduce and columnar storage
techniques to achieve a $>50\times$ speedup over traditional genomics systems. We also include
a discussion of further optimizations we made to improve data management system performance.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\cite{massie13}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Data science is a growing trend in both academia and industry
\begin{enumerate}
\item Driven by dramatic improvements in acquisition systems~(e.g., sequencing, mass spectrometry,
MRI systems)
\item Also driven by rise of statistical systems which are easy to use for non-experts~(e.g.,
Scikit-learn~\cite{pedregosa11}, MLI~\cite{sparks13})
\end{enumerate}
\item Computing is becoming a dominant cost for science
\item We need efficient ways to construct these data processing systems
\begin{enumerate}
\item Efficiency is both computational cost and development cost
\item An efficient system should be fast
\item An efficient system should be able to support a full range of analyses
\item An efficient system shouldn't reinvent the wheel
\end{enumerate}
\item Network stack achieves a similar goal:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Can swap out layers to tailor implementation
\end{enumerate}
\item Contributions of this work:
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide principles for the design of scientific analysis systems
\item Implemented fast genomic system
\item Implemented coordinate plane joins
\item Efficient lookup from block stores
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

This section will compare and contrast the various ``big data'' analysis systems with existing
scientific systems.

\begin{enumerate}
\item MapReduce-based workflows
\begin{enumerate}
\item In CS, development of MapReduce $\rightarrow$ Hadoop $\rightarrow$ Spark
\item Equivalent systems in bioinformatics $\rightarrow$ GATK \cite{mckenna10}
\item Hadoop-based genomics tools \cite{schatz09, langmead09}
\item Use of Spark for neuroscience
\end{enumerate}
\item Database driven systems
\begin{enumerate}
\item SciDB \cite{brown10}
\item GQL \cite{kozanitis14, bafna13}
\end{enumerate}
\item Storage layers
\begin{enumerate}
\item CRAM \cite{fritz11}
\item YT \cite{turk11}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Principles for Scientific \\ Analysis Systems}
\label{sec:principles}

\subsection{Workloads}
\label{sec:workloads}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Characteristics of data
\begin{enumerate}
\item Scientific data tends to be sparse
\item Different users want to look at different subsets of both rows and columns
\item Data may not always be in a single site, or stored locally
\item \emph{Experimental data} is immutable.
\item What are access patterns?
\end{enumerate}
\item Characteristics of a ideal storage system:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Efficient support for projection of different columns
\item Efficient support for per-record predicates
\item Should not relegate user to a single execution environment
\end{enumerate}
\item Processing:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Workloads are highly variable by field
\item For genomics, workloads are trivially data-parallel
\item Similar for fields with heavy image processing workloads
\item Simulation based fields are tougher; have all-to-all computation pattern, run on supercomputer
\item Defer discussion to~\S\ref{sec:execution-platforms}
\item Ideally, cross-platform.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Layering}
\label{sec:layering}

Discussion of Figure~\ref{fig:stack-model}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{stack-model.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{A Stack Model for Scientific Analysis}
\label{fig:stack-model}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Execution Platforms}
\label{sec:execution-platforms}

\textbf{TL;DW}; need to have a good discussion of what applications are good for MapReduce, what
are good on top of a database, what are good on an HPC farm, what should be done with an
abacus, etc. Needs to be written carefully to show the virtues of the Figure~\ref{fig:stack-model}
stack, while being frank about weaknesses.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

\subsection{Genomics Pipeline}
\label{sec:genomics-pipeline}

Compare/contrast to current pipelines; talk about what the stages do in reasonable but not
excessive detail. Make reference to WHAM~\cite{li11} to show that SIGMOD cares.

\subsection{Coordinate System Joins}
\label{sec:coordinate-system-joins}

This will be a compare/contrast discussion of the multiple join algorithms we've created.

\subsection{Loading Remote Data}
\label{sec:loading-remote-data}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Data may not be kept locally
\begin{enumerate}
\item Too much data to keep locally
\item Not all data is hot
\end{enumerate}
\item May push data off local disks into block store
\item What do we need to do to accommodate this?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Efficient indexing
\item Remote push-down predicate
\end{enumerate}
\item Discuss S3/Parquet interaction
\end{enumerate}

\section{Performance}
\label{sec:performance}

This section will address:

\begin{itemize}
\item Performance of ADAM on real datasets
\item Compression achieved by Parquet
\item Examples extending the proposed stack to Astronomy
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Scientific Processing on MapReduce}
\label{sec:scientific-compute-mr}

Big critique from SciDB camp is that MR is an inappropriate platform for scientific computing due to
lack of support for linear algebra. We need to counter this point, by allusion to performance on
algorithms above, and by alluding to specialized libraries for ML \& graph
processing~\cite{sparks13, xin13}.

\subsection{Cost of Non-Commodity Systems}
\label{sec:commodity}

The advantage of the stack model we propose is that it enables the use and reuse of commodity
systems, instead of re-inventing the wheel (or, inventing a \emph{slightly} different wheel).

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In the end, we conclude.
